## Collaborative To-Do App with User Roles

A task management web application built as a test project. It features user registration, authentication, and session management via tokens. Users can create and manage to-do lists, add tasks with titles and descriptions, mark them as completed, and invite collaborators with different access levels. Each list supports two roles: Admin and Viewer. The app has a clean UI and supports seamless multi-user interaction.
